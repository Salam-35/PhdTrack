# Dashboard Redesign - Summary of Changes

## Overview
This document summarizes all changes made to redesign the dashboard and improve the university tracking functionality.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
**File:** `/scripts/add-acceptance-funding.sql`
- Added `acceptance_funding_status` column to `universities` table
- Possible values: `'with-funding'`, `'without-funding'`, `'pending'`, `'unknown'`
- Helps distinguish between acceptances with and without funding

### 2. TypeScript Interface Updates
**File:** `/lib/supabase.ts`
- Updated `University` interface to include `acceptance_funding_status` field
- Type: `"with-funding" | "without-funding" | "pending" | "unknown"`
- Made it optional to maintain backward compatibility

### 3. Dashboard Component Redesign
**File:** `/components/dashboard.tsx`

#### Spending Calculation Fixed (Lines 54-65)
**Before:** Only counted applications with status `"submitted"`
```typescript
const totalSpent = universities
  ?.filter(u => u.status === "submitted")
  .reduce((sum, u) => sum + (Number(u.application_fee) || 0), 0) ?? 0
```

**After:** Counts all submitted and beyond statuses
```typescript
const totalSpent = universities
  ?.filter(u =>
    u.status === "submitted" ||
    u.status === "under-review" ||
    u.status === "interview" ||
    u.status === "accepted" ||
    u.status === "rejected" ||
    u.status === "waitlisted"
  )
  .reduce((sum, u) => sum + (Number(u.application_fee) || 0), 0) ?? 0
```

#### University Sorting (Lines 73-95)
Added intelligent sorting based on status priority:
1. Accepted with funding (highest priority)
2. Accepted without funding
3. Accepted (unknown funding)
4. Interview
5. Waitlisted
6. Under review
7. Submitted
8. In progress
9. Rejected
10. Not started (lowest priority)

Secondary sort by deadline (earlier deadlines first)

#### New Universities Section (Lines 201-258)
Added a new card section showing all universities:
- Sorted by status priority
- Clear funding status badges:
  - **Dark Green**: Accepted with Funding
  - **Light Green**: Accepted without Funding
  - **Green**: Accepted (unknown funding)
  - **Orange**: Interview
  - **Yellow**: Waitlisted
  - **Purple**: Under Review
  - **Yellow**: Submitted
  - **Blue**: In Progress
  - **Red**: Rejected
  - **Gray**: Not Started
- Shows application fee for each university
- Responsive design with proper text truncation

### 4. University Form Updates
**File:** `/components/forms/university-form.tsx`

#### Added Acceptance Funding Status Field (Lines 293-315)
- Only appears when status is "accepted"
- Dropdown with clear options:
  - "Accepted with Funding"
  - "Accepted without Funding"
  - "Funding Decision Pending"
  - "Unknown"
- Includes helpful description text
- Default value: "unknown"

### 5. Applications Page Updates
**File:** `/components/applications.tsx`

#### Updated Status Display (Lines 109-129)
- `getStatusColor()` function now accepts funding status parameter
- Different green shades for funded vs non-funded acceptances
- `getStatusLabel()` shows clear labels:
  - "Accepted (Funded)"
  - "Accepted (No Funding)"
  - Standard status labels for other states

## Benefits

### 1. Clear Funding Status

- No more confusion about funding status
- Easy to identify best opportunities at a glance

### 2. Accurate Financial Tracking
- Total spent now includes all submitted applications
- More realistic budget tracking
- Helps users understand their total investment

### 3. Prioritized University List
- Most important updates (funded acceptances) appear first
- Helps users focus on time-sensitive decisions
- Organized workflow from most to least urgent

### 4. Better User Experience
- Sorted dashboard view
- Color-coded status badges
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Responsive design

## Migration Required

To use these features, you must run the database migration:
```bash
# See MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md for detailed steps
```

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Add filters to view only funded acceptances
2. Add statistics for funded vs non-funded acceptances
3. Export functionality for acceptance comparisons
4. Deadline reminders for funding decisions
5. Integration with financial aid calculators
